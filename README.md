# Home Value Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project leverages Python along with popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn to predict home values in both the United States and the DFW Metroplex region. Our predictive model is built using data from the Federal Reserve and Zillow.
